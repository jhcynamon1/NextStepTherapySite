- **"Mental health" pages**: 3% of 27,100 = 813 monthly visits potential  
- **"Couples therapy" pages**: 8% of 14,800 = 1,184 monthly visits potential
- **Combined potential**: 3,000+ monthly organic visits

### **Client Acquisition Potential:**
- **2% conversion rate** = 60 leads/month
- **10% lead-to-client rate** = 6 new clients/month
- **$150/session √ó 10 sessions** = $9,000 monthly revenue potential per client
- **Total monthly revenue potential**: $54,000

## üéØ **Next Steps (Corrected Priorities)**

### **Immediate (Week 1-2):**
1. **Build "counselling" landing page templates** (highest volume, lowest competition)
2. **Create "mental health services" content strategy**
3. **Develop location-based variants for Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton**

### **Month 1:**
1. **Launch 10-15 "counselling" + location pages**
2. **Create "couples therapy" content calendar**
3. **Begin anxiety therapy niche content**

### **Month 2-3:**
1. **Scale to 25-30 location/demographic combinations**
2. **Add seasonal content for January/April peaks**
3. **Monitor rankings and optimize based on performance**

## ‚úÖ **Key Takeaways**

1. **The original anxiety therapy opportunity is still valid** but smaller than broader terms
2. **"Counselling" and "mental health" are the real goldmines** (27,100/month each, LOW competition)
3. **Many specific therapy types have too low volume** to be primary targets
4. **Canadian spelling and seasonal timing are critical**
5. **Location-based strategy is more important** than niche-specific strategy

**Bottom Line**: Focus on broad, high-volume terms with location/demographic modifiers rather than ultra-specific therapy types. The volume and competition data supports a broader content strategy than originally planned.
